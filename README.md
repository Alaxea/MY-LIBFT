What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at 42 that requieres us to re-create some standard C library functions for future projects, and have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At 42 we are not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this libary with our own functions as we go farther in the program. I believe that my project will help others to understand the basics of C language.

What's in it?
There are 3 sections:

Libc Functions: Some of the standard C functions
Additional functions: Functions that will be useful for later projects
Personal Functions: Functions I believe will be useful later.
